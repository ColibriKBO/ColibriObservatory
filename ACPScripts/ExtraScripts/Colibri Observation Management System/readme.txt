The RunColibriScheduler.js should be ran on ACP, while the RunColibriSchedulerLocal.js should be ran on your local machine on any IDE such as VSCode.
To run the file the input file (colibri_user_observations.csv) must have all 11 columns filled out, and have a start time which is after sunset in UTC, and an end time which is before sunrise in UTC.
The output file (sorted_user_observations.csv) has the schedule of observations and also has units for all the columns.
